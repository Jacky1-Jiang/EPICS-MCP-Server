# EPICS-MCP-Server
# Overview
The EPICS MCP Server is a Python-based server designed to interact with EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System) process variables (PVs). It provides a set of tools to retrieve PV values, set PV values, and fetch detailed information about PVs. The server is built using the mcp framework and communicates over stdio, making it suitable for integration into larger control systems or workflows.

This tool is particularly useful in environments where EPICS PVs are used for monitoring and controlling hardware or software parameters.
